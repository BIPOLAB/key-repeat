## Build
Key Repeat was developed in C++ using the JUCE audio framework. Here's how to build the project yourself:
1. Download [JUCE](https://shop.juce.com/get-juce "Get JUCE").
2. Open `key-repeat.jucer` in the Projucer.
3. Use the Projucer to generate a Visual Studio project on Windows or XCode project on Mac.
4. Use your IDE's built tool to build the project.

Note that with Visual Studio on Windows, you can only build the Windows-compatible VST3. With XCode on Mac, you can build the Mac-compatible VST3 and AU.
