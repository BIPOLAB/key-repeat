Key Repeat is currently a **work in progress**. Downloads in VST3, AU[v3], and AAX formats will be available soon!

## Why Key Repeat?
With Key Repeat, you get:
* **Efficiency.** Drag in any sample and start recording note-repeats instantly. Key Repeat syncs itself to your DAW's tempo.
* **Ease of Use.** Turn on EZ Triplet mode and never hold two keyswitches again! See the manual [WIP] for more info.
* **Control.** Whether it's tweaking your sample's ADSR envelope, throwing in some refreshing humanization, or adding in a slight swing, Key Repeat puts you in control of your note-repeats.

For a more thorough overview of features, check out the manual [WIP].
